## Icelandic Pirate Party

I co-founded the Icelandic Pirate Party and stood as their number one candidate in Iceland's south 
constituency in the 2013 general elections, and again, more successfully, in 2016.

## Nordic Voting Systems

I've been doing some research into Nordic voting systems (in particular, Iceland, Sweden and Norway) with Þorkell Helgason and Kurt Jörnsten. One of the outputs is a voting system simulator, available [here][18].

## OCCRP

From 2014-2016 I was the chief technologist at the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. It was a wonderful job. A lot of the software we built is freely available on [OCCRP's Github][17].

## Mailpile

I'm one of the folks behind [Mailpile][1], a modern, fast web-mail client with user-friendly encryption and privacy features. It's free software, written in Python, available on [Github][2]. If you want to talk about it, join #mailpile on irc.freenode.net.

## Liquid Democracy

Around 2007 I started thinking about the shortcomings of democracy as it stands, and started writing about it. In 2008 I did a talk at Oekonux 4, where I presented some of the ideas about how to democratize democracy by allowing proxying of votes. Since then I've become acquainted with the works of Miller, Hill, Lomax, Hodgeson and others on this same field, which predate my own work. However, I seem to have triggered this most recent interest, which has generated useful software built by a host of smart people.

I frequently work on issues related to this; mostly writing and lecturing. I built [Wasa2il][3], a free software platform for Liquid Democracy.

## IMMI

I'm a co-founder of the [International Modern Media Institute][8] and served as its first executive director. I am now a board member of that organization.

## Older projects

Some of these I haven't worked on for a while... some live good lives without me, others have faded into history or taken on new lives with 
others at the helm:

 * [CAST][9]
 * [FabFi][10]
 * [FabFolk][11]
 * [Fab Lab Afghanistan][12]
 * [Tangible Bit][13]
 * [Fab Lab Vestmannaeyjar][14]
 * [Shadow Parliament Project][15]
 * [Félag um Stafrænt Frelsi][16]
